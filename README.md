The function BrierDecomp() has the following input and output.

INPUT:
- p: 1d array of predicted probabilities
- y: 1d array of binary observations (0 or 1)
- bins: to estimate the calibration function, default: 10
- bias_corrected: logical, default=False, if false, the standard (biased) decomposition of Murphy (1973) is used, \\
                                              if true, the bias-corrected decomposition of Ferro (2012) (See References in Readme)\\
OUTPUT:
    1) dictionary with estimates of Reliability, Resolution and Uncertainty
    2) dictionary with corresponding std. deviations
